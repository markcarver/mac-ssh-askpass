If you've gotten this error:

        remote: ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/libexec/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory

Then you probably need this script. Mac OS X does not prompt for a password outside of Terminal when connecting via SSH (for security reasons). This script grants any application the ability to prompt the user for a password via an AppleScript dialog.

>       4. Enter your password

>       7. Press `esc` to go out of edit mode
>       8. Type `:` then `w` and press `return` to write the file
>       9. Type `:` then `x` and press `return` to exit vi
>       10. Type `sudo chmod +rx /usr/libexec/ssh-askpass` to make the script executable
>       11. Test the script! Type `/usr/libexec/ssh-askpass`

>_NOTE: You must run as `root` or precede the commands with `sudo` when using `INSTALL` or `vi`. The directory `/usr/libexec` is owned by `root`._
